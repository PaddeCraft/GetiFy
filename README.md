## Developement

If you want to change something, here are some things:
 - To renew the css, use `yarn css`, or any command that will run the css task from the `package.json`-file. You might need to run `yarn install` the first time to install the packages.
 - If you plan on publishing your changes, please use a code formatter. I recommend black, but you can use any other (e.g. prettier) too.
 - If you make any changes to CSS-code which is not generated by tailwindcss, please make sure that is is compatible with dark and light mode. To test this in chromium-based browsers, use `ctrl` + `shift` + `P` in the devtools and search for `Emulate CSS prefers-color-scheme: dark` or `Emulate CSS prefers-color-scheme: light`.
